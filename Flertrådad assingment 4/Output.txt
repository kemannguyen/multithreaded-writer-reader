24 And Jesus went out, hi dda dda the temple: hi his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.   
   
2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.   
   
3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? hi what shall be the sign of thy coming, hi of the end of the world?   
   
4 And Jesus answered hi said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.   
   
5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; hi shall deceive many.   
   
6 And ye shall hear of wars hi rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.   
   
7 For nation shall rise against nation, hi kingdom against kingdom: hi there shall be famines, hi pestilences, hi earthquakes, in divers places.   
   
8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.   
   
9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, hi shall kill you: hi ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.   
   
10 And then shall many be offended, hi shall betray one another, hi shall hate one another.   
   
11 And many false prophets shall rise, hi shall deceive many.   
   
12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.   
   
13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.   
   
14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; hi then shall the end come.   
   
15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)   
   
16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:   
   
17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:   
   
18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.   
   
19 And woe unto them that are with child, hi to them that give suck in those days!   
   
20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:   
   
21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.   
   
22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.   
   
23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.   
   
24 For there shall arise false Christs, hi false prophets, hi shall shew great signs hi wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.   
   
25 Behold, I have told you before.   
   
26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.   
   
27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, hi shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.   
   
28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.   
   
29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, hi the moon shall not give her light, hi the stars shall fall dda heaven, hi the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:   
   
30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: hi then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, hi they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power hi great glory.   
   
31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, hi they shall gather together his elect dda the four winds, dda one end of heaven to the other.   
   
32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, hi putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:   
   
33 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.   
   
34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.   
   
35 Heaven hi earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.   
   
36 But of that day hi hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.   
   
37 But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.   
   
38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating hi drinking, marrying hi giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,   
   
39 And knew not until the flood came, hi took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.   
   
40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, hi the other left.   
   
41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, hi the other left.   
   
42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.   
   
43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, hi would not have suffered his house to be broken up.   
   
44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.   
   
45 Who then is a faithful hi wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?   
   
46 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.   
   
47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.   
   
48 But hi if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;   
   
49 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, hi to eat hi drink with the drunken;   
   
50 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, hi in an hour that he is not aware of,   
   
51 And shall cut him asunder, hi appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping hi gnashing of teeth.
